const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/docs/{docId}/share', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ permission: 'read' })
});
```
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.example.com/v1/docs/{docId}/share',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'},
    json={'permission': 'read'}
